An advanced AI agent that ingests and understands GitHub repositories using a sophisticated multi-agent and hybrid memory architecture, allowing for deep, context-aware conversations about any codebase.

## üèõÔ∏è System Architecture

RepoRover operates using a central **Dispatcher Agent** that orchestrates two primary workflows: **Ingestion** and **Querying**. This multi-agent system is powered by an advanced cognitive memory architecture, allowing it to build a deep, contextual understanding of a codebase.

### The Agent Team

-   **Dispatcher Agent**: The central coordinator that manages user interactions and orchestrates the ingestion and query workflows.
-   **Architect Agent**: Parses Python source code to build a structural map of the repository, identifying classes, functions, and their relationships.
-   **Librarian Agent**: Reads and processes documentation files (like Markdown), splitting them into manageable chunks for semantic analysis.
-   **Annotator Agent**: Enriches the code map by generating concise, natural-language summaries for all identified functions.
-   **Query Planner Agent**: Takes a user's question and creates a logical, step-by-step plan of tool calls required to answer it, leveraging conversational history for context.
-   **Information Retriever Agent**: Executes the plan generated by the Query Planner, gathering data from the various memory stores.
-   **Synthesizer Agent**: Generates the final, human-readable response, using the collected data, conversation history, and the agent's persona to craft a coherent answer.

### The Advanced Memory System

The agent's cognitive ability is powered by multiple specialized memory systems that work in concert.

| Memory Type | Purpose | Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **üß† Core Memory** | Stores the agent's persona and core instructions, ensuring a consistent personality. | JSON file managed by a Pydantic class. |
| **üí¨ Episodic Memory** | A time-stamped log of all interactions, enabling conversational recall. | SQLite database. |
| **üß© Semantic Memory** | A **hybrid** system that stores the meaning and relationships of code and documentation. | ChromaDB (Vectors) + NetworkX (Graph) + SQLite (Entities). |
| **üõ†Ô∏è Procedural Memory**| Defines the step-by-step agent workflows for ingestion and querying. | JSON-defined task sequences. |

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.9+
-   An environment manager (`venv` is built-in, or you can use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/))

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/RepoRover.git](https://github.com/yourusername/RepoRover.git)
    cd RepoRover
    ```

2.  Set up your environment and install dependencies.

    **Option A: Using `venv` (Recommended)**
    ```bash
    # Create and activate the virtual environment
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `.\venv\Scripts\activate`

    # Install dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    **Option B: Using Poetry**
    ```bash
    # Install dependencies
    poetry install
    ```

3.  Set up environment variables:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    # Edit .env with your configuration, including your GEMINI_API_KEY
    ```
