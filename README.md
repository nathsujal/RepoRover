An advanced AI agent that ingests and understands GitHub repositories using a sophisticated multi-agent and hybrid memory architecture, allowing for deep, context-aware conversations about any codebase.

---

## üöÄ Features

-   **Central Dispatcher**: A single, intelligent agent manages all user interactions, routing tasks for ingestion or querying.
-   **Specialized Agent Team**: A full roster of agents (Librarian, Architect, Annotator, Query Planner, etc.) handle specific, dedicated tasks.
-   **Advanced Cognitive Memory**: Goes beyond simple vector search, utilizing six distinct memory types for a more human-like understanding of context, procedures, and knowledge.
-   **Hybrid Semantic Search**: Combines a Vector Store (for conceptual meaning), a Knowledge Graph (for structural relationships), and an Entity Store (for factual details) into a powerful, unified Semantic Memory.
-   **Secure Knowledge Storage**: A dedicated, encrypted Knowledge Vault for handling sensitive information like API keys found in a repository.
-   **Procedural Workflows**: Agent tasks are defined in editable JSON workflows, making the system's procedures modular and easy to modify.

## üèõÔ∏è System Architecture

The system is orchestrated by a central **Dispatcher Agent** that serves as the "front door" for all operations. It intelligently routes user input to one of two main workflows: Ingestion or Querying.



### The Advanced Memory System

The agent's cognitive ability is powered by six specialized memory systems:

| Memory Type         | Purpose                                          | Implementation                               |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| **üß† Core Memory** | Agent's persona and user preferences             | JSON file managed by a Pydantic class        |
| **üí¨ Episodic Memory** | Time-stamped log of all interactions             | SQLite database table                        |
| **üß© Semantic Memory** | **(Hybrid)** Code/doc meaning and relationships  | ChromaDB (Vectors) + Neo4j (Graph) + SQLite (Entities) |
| **üõ†Ô∏è Procedural Memory**| Step-by-step agent workflows                   | JSON-defined task sequences                  |
| **üìÑ Resource Memory** | Catalog of external references                 | SQLite database table                        |
| **üîê Knowledge Vault** | Secure storage for sensitive facts & secrets     | HashiCorp Vault or an Encrypted File         |

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (for running databases like Neo4j)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RepoRover.git
   cd RepoRover
   ```

2. Install dependencies using Poetry:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

### Running the Application

Start the development server:
```bash
poetry run uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The API will be available at http://localhost:8000

### Running Tests

```bash
poetry run pytest
```
